    "This has shown that the problem can't be solved as a convex quadratic program or geometric program as-is. Possible next steps:\n",
    "1) Find another way to make the problem convex. For example, Zhong and Yeung 2018 (OMAE) shows that constraining the slew rate of PTO force can guarantee convexity for a single WEC, and Zhong and Yeung 2022 (Ocean Engineering) shows that constraining reactive power to zero (pure damping control) can guarantee convexity for an array.\n",
    "2) Give up on convexity and try to solve it as a nonconvex QP with a different solver, which should still be faster than solving it as a NLP but would not have the benefits of convexity such as \"free\" sensitivities or global optimiality.\n",
    "3) Give up on trying to leverage the QP structure, and use the current NLP solvers like SLSQP and interior point."
