# these paths below must be absolute, or relative to where powergenome is being called from,
# unlike all other paths in the pg settings file which are relative (to the settings file or input folder).
# That is why we use the PG_DATA_FOLDER env variable, to make them absolute.
# The env variable is expanded and the settings copied to the case settings folder in the run_powergenome.sh script.
