# The keys in cost_multiplier_technology_map are technologies listed in EIA's capital
# cost assumptions document. The 2020 version is available at
# https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/aeo20/assumptions/pdf/table_8.2.pdf
# Values in the list are string-matched to technologies (`<tech>_<tech_detail>`) from ATB.
# Be sure to include any custom technologies you are using from `additional_technologies_fn`
# or `modified_atb_new_gen`.
# If a value in one of the lists matches more than one technology, the cost multiplier
# will only be applied to the first technology.
# If you want to modify the regional cost corrections CSV, you can put your own copy in
# the folder PowerGenome/data/cost_multipliers.
